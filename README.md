# Why does GyazoBot exist?

Similar to [Imgur Album Bot (which this was inspired by)](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot), this bot helps save bandwidth by directly loading Gyazo images, instead of an entire web page.

Originally active on /u/Gyazo_Bot, shut down on Nov 18, 2018 and archived on May 5, 2019.

v2: Now hosts imgur mirror as well!
